<h1 style=text-align:center;background-color:green;color:white;>NATURE</h1>

<h2 style=color:navy;font-family:sans-serif;>Everything we see around us</h2>

<p style=font-family:cursive;font-size:120%;text-indent:10%;>Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. 
In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. 
For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another.
 Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things.
 Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planet’s beauty.
 Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature.
 Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.
  The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements are linked.
 Natural ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process natural materials for use in today’s ever-changing world and destroy their rawness and individuality.
 Human activities have an impact on nature, and as a result, the quality of the environment is deteriorating.

Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival. 
It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components.
 But deforestation has been the primary cause of global warming, destroying nature.
 In addition to exploiting excessive natural resources, other industries pollute the environment with toxic gases and chemicals. 
 It is now essential to reduce biological damage, reuse things, and recycle existing materials to create new ones.
 People from all over the world should join forces to relieve pressure on the environment and restore its balance. 
 It is now the essential aim to serve nature with utmost care to save our nature from hazards and threats.

 Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of religious traditions.Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the air and water. The oxygen produced by a single fully-grown tree is enough to supply ten people, and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is unquestionably adequate for a metropolis or town.
