<h1 style="text-align:center;background-color:Lavender";>Sky!!</h1>
<p style="font-family:cursive;font-size:140%;text-indent:8%";>What is the sky really? It’s interesting because the sky can be so many different things to us: 
it can be big, beautiful and blue, or grey, cloudy and rainy. It can also be full of stars, or full of orange and red clouds at sunset or sunrise.
The reason the sky can appear to be so many different things is because what we perceive as the sky is actually just the different behaviours of a
 massive layer of gas above our heads. That layer, which we call an atmosphere, is stuck to our planet,
 Earth, by an invisible force called gravity, and we are at the bottom of it. And depending on the time of day and
 the conditions in the atmosphere, we will see different things.</p>

<p style="font-family:cursive;font-size:140%;text-indent:7%">You’ve probably noticed that the sky is especially different between daytime and nighttime, and the reason for that is the sun.
When it’s daytime for us, the side of the Earth we’re on is facing the sun, which means the incredibly bright light that 
the sun generates is smacking into our atmosphere. The light from the sun is made up of all the colours of the rainbow from 
red through blue, and our atmosphere is especially good at scattering the blue light. That means when the sun’s light hits 
the atmosphere, most of it goes straight through, but the blue light is bounced all over the place! So as we sit below our 
layer of gas,the atmosphere, we see lots of blue light coming from all directions.</p>
